## Probability and Statistics

1. (13)(48) / (52 choose 5)

There are (52 choose 5) distinct poker hands (without regard to order). To obtain four of a kind,

(a) choose the face value to appear four times (13 choices: A, K, Q, ..., 2)

(b) choose the fifth card (52 - 4 = 48 remaing cards to choose from)

Thus *P* = (13)(48) / (52 choose 5)
